# Introduction
A company that I was interviewing with asked me to create this as a coding challenge. The challenge can be viewed below in the README.md file.

## Air Garage Coding Challenge
Build a front end app that pulls the lowest rated lots given a region and displays them.

### Instructions on Use

1. Once you have the app cloned, navigate to the main app directory.
2. Open the `SearchBar.js` file and add the bearer token to `line 8`.
3. Navigate [Herokuapp](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)
4. Click on the button that says *Request temporary access to the demo server* 
5. In a terminal, run `npm build` then `npm start`. The app should now be running.
6. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the broswer.
7. You should see an input field and a button that says search. Type in any city and state.
8. Results should appear at the bottom of the page.
